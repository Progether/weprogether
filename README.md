# README

## Synopsis

Culturally, we want to make everything related to the Progether project a
potential learning experience. It is in this vein that I have decided to make
the source for www.weprogether.com open to anyone who is interested in working
on it with me.

## Installation

Clone this repository to a web server. Please work using feature branches. This
means when you have a feature to add, create a branch for it, and make any
of your commits to it. The Workflow section goes into more detail on the exact
commands you will be using to do this. When you are prepared to submit your
final pull request for merging, you can do so from this feature branch. I will
then review the changes for merging into master. From there, they will be used
on the actual weprogether.com website!

## Workflow

As stated in the Installation section, we use a feature branch based workflow, like so:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Progether/weprogether.git
cd weprogether
git checkout master
git pull
git checkout -b <weprogether-yourfeaturebranchname>
make changes
git add <changed files>
git commit -m 'Useful, short message describing your most recent changes'
make changes
git add <changed files>
git commit -m 'Useful, concise message describing your changes since the last commit'
git push origin <weprogether-yourfeaturebranchname>
```

Once you have pushed to Github.com, log into Github.com and open a Pull Request from your feature branch, which I will review and either reject (with comments to help you fix any glaring issues), or merge into the master branch.

Easy peasy!
